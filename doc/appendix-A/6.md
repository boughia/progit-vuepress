<p>From version 3.2 onwards, Sublime Text has git integration in the editor.</p>

<div class="itemized-list">
<ul>
<li>
<span class="principal">The sidebar will show the git status of files and folders with a badge/icon.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">Files and folders that are in your .gitignore file will be faded out in the sidebar.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">In the status bar, you can see the current git branch and how many modifications you have made.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">All changes to a file are now visible via markers in the gutter.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="principal">You can use part of the Sublime Merge git client functionality from within Sublime Text.
(This requires that Sublime Merge is installed. See: <a href="https://www.sublimemerge.com/" class="link">https://www.sublimemerge.com/</a>)</span>
